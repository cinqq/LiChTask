# Getting Started


This is copy from https://github.com/klarzynskik/simple-form + tests.

This is a project created using Create React App. In order to start, you should install dependencies first via the `npm install` in the project root.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run cy:open`

Starts a Cypress GUI. Currently, it is set up with `baseUrl` set to `localhost`, so make sure the app is also running

### `npm run cy:run`

Runs Cypress tests headlessly. App should be running before in order to make it work.
